# Dimensionality-reduction-techniques
These techniques has been tested on popular datasets of MNIST and Olivetti faces Datasets. After the dimensionality reduction, the resulting data will have less features which contribute in driving the results. So we test the accuracy of the reduced dimensionality dataset at the end.
